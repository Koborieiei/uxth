(She’s the co-author of Handbook of Usability\n            Testing Second Edition.) Usability testing is a great tool for\n            identifying frustrating points in a design, but what happens after\n            that? She set out to understand what you do after you’ve eliminated\n            all of the frustration with a design — surely, there must be\n            something beyond satisfaction. Her delight framework goes beyond\n            tickling the fancies of users (whatever that means) to looking at\n            how to design for pleasure, flow, and meaning.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Resting on her laurels after working for President Obama at the U.S.\n            Digital Service (2014-16), Dana is a co-founder of the Center for\n            Civic Design with Whitney Quesenbery, where her team works to ensure\n            that every interaction people have with government is efficient,\n            effective, and pleasant.\n          </Content>\n        </>\n      ),\n    }}\n  />\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
