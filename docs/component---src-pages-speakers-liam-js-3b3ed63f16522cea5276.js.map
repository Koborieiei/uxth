We might not\n            always be aware of them, and they might not be conscious of it. But\n            the fact of the matter is, the design of a delightful customer\n            experience doesn't come from a single person, nor does it come from\n            a role (job title).\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            How do we drop the \"rockstar designer\" attitude, drive shared\n            understanding, embrace an inclusive and diverse process and make it\n            our goal to help everyone become as excellent a designer as they can\n            be? We'll ask these questions, but first, we'll start with why we\n            should.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            This is a conversation about how we look at others when designing\n            products and services.
