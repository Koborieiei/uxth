We can zoom in to the screen level,\n            looking directly at what in the interactions on a single screen or\n            page. We can zoom out a little to look at an entire application’s\n            design, understanding how screens work together. Or we can pull back\n            to an organization level, working to connect applications and other\n            services together.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Looking at design through different levels of resolution helps us\n            answer some important questions. Is there a difference between UX\n            and UI, and if so, how does that change how teams should operate?\n            What is the relationship between product design and service design?\n            How do we start preparing for what comes next?\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            In this entertaining talk, Jared explores the relationships between\n            these new levels of resolution.

He started working in the field\n            of usability and user experience in 1978, before the terms\n            \"usability\" and \"UX\" were ever associated with computers.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            While he led UIE, the industry research firm he started in 1988, the\n            field of UX design emerged and Jared helped define what makes UX\n            designers successful all over the world. UIE's world-class research\n            organization produces conferences and workshops all over the world\n            and for companies in every industry.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            In 2016, with Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman, he opened Center Centre, a\n            new school in Chattanooga, TN to create the next generation of\n            industry-ready UX Designers. They created a revolutionary approach\n            to vocational training, infusing Jared's decades of UX experience\n            with Leslie's mastery of experience-based learning methodologies.\n            UIE joined forces with Center Centre and now delivers the best\n            professional development workshops, masterclasses, and conference in\n            the UX Design industry.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            You'll also find him as the conference chair and keynote speaker at\n            the annual UI Conference and UX Immersion Conference, and he manages\n            to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time. He is author of the\n            book, Web Usability: A Designer’s Guide and co-author of Web\n            Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks that Work.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            You'll find his writing at uie.com. You can also follow his\n            adventures on the Twitters at @jmspool, where he tweets daily about\n            UX design, design strategy, design education, and the wondrous\n            customer service habits of the airline industry.\n          </Content>\n        </>\n      ),\n    }}\n  />\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
